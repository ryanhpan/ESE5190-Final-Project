# Proposal

We combine the IMU and LCD screen in Pico4ml to build a simple step counter.

# Code

We found the code for Magic Wand and made some modifications based on it. We are now able to successfully read the IMU data from ICM20948 and get it to display on the LCD screen (LCD_st7735) which is used by PIO.

Also, following Dalton's advice, we tried to find a few fixed reference points based on the camera module but we observed that the array read by camera was strange and it was hard to extract the data from it and find a few points as coordinate points. So we gave up that idea. 

The code is [here](https://github.com/ryanhpan/ESE5190-Final-Project/tree/main/code/in-progress).

- The IMU module detects the movement of the user and generates the data of acceleration of linear velocity and  angular velocity.
- The Filter Algorithms remove the high frequency noise from the raw data. 
- The Data Processor identifies the signal pattern of “walking”.
- The Program counts the amount of steps in a certain amount of time.
- LCD Screen shows the amount of steps on the screen.
